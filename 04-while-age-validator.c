// Practice exercise: input validation with while loops.
// Goal: keep asking for an age until it is between 0 and 120 inclusive.
// TODOs for you:
// 1) Use a while loop to re-prompt the user when the age is out of range.
// 2) Once a valid age is entered, print a confirmation like
//    "Thanks, you entered <age>".
// Expected interaction example:
//    Enter age: -5
//    Please enter an age between 0 and 120.
//    Enter age: 300
//    Please enter an age between 0 and 120.
//    Enter age: 25
//    Thanks, you entered 25
// Hint: initialize age with an impossible value so the loop runs at least once.
int main(void) {
    int age = -1;

    // TODO: add your while loop here to validate the input.
    while (age < 0 || age > 120) {
        printf("Enter age: ");
        scanf("%d", &age);

        if (age < 0 || age > 120) {
            printf("Please enter an age between 0 and 120.\n");
        }
    }

    // This code runs only after a valid age is entered.
    printf("Thanks, you entered %d\n", age);

    return 0;
